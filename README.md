# To-Do List
This To-Do list was created to practice React, JavaScript and Firebase. Creating this application allowed me to learn about Firebase hosting and database.

## Installation

- Clone repo to your local machine.
- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` to open in local server.

## Tests

To run the tests, run the command `yarn test`.

The tests follow this syntax: 
```
  it("should call a function on button click", () => {
    expect(testFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0);
    component.simulate("click");
    expect(testFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```
